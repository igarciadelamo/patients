# Patients

Web application written in React in order to manage patients and their treatments and bills.
## Why?

The main reason is to use React in a personal project.

## Previous steps

It is necessary to create a firebase application, with its own credentials. This way, the application can store the patient info.

Set the app info in the file src/firebaseConfig.js, replacing the stars for the correct values in the object config.

## Execution

To run the application from local:

> yarn run start
